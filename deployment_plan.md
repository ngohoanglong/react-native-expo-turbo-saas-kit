### Phase 1: Enhance the React Native App

1.  **Image Library Access:** I will integrate `expo-image-picker` to allow the app to access the device's photo library.
2.  **Image Selection UI:** I will create a user interface where users can view their device's images and select which ones to sync.
3.  **Upload Logic:** I will implement the logic to upload the selected images to your Supabase Storage. This will include handling upload progress and potential errors.
4.  **Background Sync (Optional but Recommended):** To improve the user experience, I can implement a background task using `expo-task-manager` that automatically syncs new images.

### Phase 2: Configure the Supabase Backend

1.  **Storage Bucket:** I will create a dedicated storage bucket in your Supabase project to store the synced images.
2.  **Database Table:** I will create a new table in your Supabase database to store metadata for each image (e.g., filename, size, user ID, etc.).
3.  **Security Policies:** I will configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies on both the storage bucket and the database table to ensure that users can only access their own images.

### Phase 3: Deployment

1.  **Build and Deploy the App:** I will use EAS (Expo Application Services) to build the Android and iOS versions of your app and guide you through the process of submitting them to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
2.  **Production-Ready Backend:** I will ensure your Supabase project is configured for a production environment.
